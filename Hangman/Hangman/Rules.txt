Welcome to Hangman!

Rules:

The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word or phrase.
You have a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed, typically 8.
Guess letters one at a time. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.
If the letter is not in the word, part of a hangman figure is drawn.
Continue guessing until you correctly guess the entire word or phrase or make too many incorrect guesses.
Win by guessing the word before making too many incorrect guesses. Lose if you exceed the maximum allowed incorrect guesses.

Have fun playing Hangman!
